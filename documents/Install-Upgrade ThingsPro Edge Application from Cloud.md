### Azure IoT Hub

We are going to invoke an Azure IoT Hub Direct Method to launch OTA software upgrade from cloud to IIoT Gateway, such as AIG-301.

#### 1. Upload your software package files to Azure Blob storage

The package files included below 3 files, and please let all of them are public accessible.

| File      | Example                       | Note          |
| --------- | ----------------------------- | ------------- |
| xxx.yaml  | My-App2_1.0.0_armhf.yaml      | Public Access |
| xxx.zsync | My-App2_1.0.0_armhf.deb.zsync | Public Access |
| xxx.deb   | My-App2_1.0.0_armhf.deb       | Public Access |



#### 2. Connect your IIoT Gateway, such as AIG-301, to Azure IoT Hub

Of cause, you need to connect your IIoT Gateway to Azure IoT Hub either by Azure IoT Device or Azure IoT Edge.

If your IIoT Gateway connects as Azure IoT Edge, you have to deploy **thingspro-agent**, a module of Azure IoT Edge, before go for next.

#### 2. Upload AWS IoT Core Job definition file to AWS S3 storage

You need to provide Job definition file to AWS IoT Core when you submit a Job.

```
{
  "name": "thingspro-software-upgrade",
  "payload": "{\"downloadURL\":\"https://xxxx/xxx.yaml\",\"runInstallation\":true}"
}
```

Save it as file, and upload to AWS S3 storage. This file can be private.
